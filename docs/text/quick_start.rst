Quick Start
===========


Install tsfresh
---------------

As the compiled tsfresh package is hosted on pypy you can easily install it with pip

.. code:: shell

   pip install tsfresh


Dive in
-------

Before boring yourself by reading the docs in detail, you can dive right into tsfresh with the following example:

We are given a data set containing robot failures as discussed in [1].
Each robot records time series from six different sensors.
For each sample denoted by a different id we are going to classify if the robot reports a failure or not.
From a machine learning point of view, our goal is to classify each group of time series.

To start, we load the data into python

.. code:: python

    from tsfresh.examples.robot_execution_failures import download_robot_execution_failures, load_robot_execution_failures
    download_robot_execution_failures()
    timeseries, y = load_robot_execution_failures()

and end up with a pandas.DataFrame `timeseries` having the following shape

+-----+-----+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|     | id  | time| a  | b  | c  | d  | e  | f  |
+=====+=====+=====+====+====+====+====+====+====+
| 0   | 1   | 0   | -1 |-1  | 63 | -3 | -1 | 0  |
+-----+-----+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 0  | 0  | 62 | -3 | -1 | 0  |
+-----+-----+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| 2   | 1   | 2   | -1 |-1  | 61 | -3 | 0  | 0  |
+-----+-----+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| 3   | 1   | 3   | -1 |-1  | 63 | -2 | -1 | 0  |
+-----+-----+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| 4   | 1   | 4   | -1 |-1  | 63 | -3 | -1 | 0  |
+-----+-----+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| ... | ... | ... | ...| ...|... | ...| ...| ...|
+-----+-----+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

The first column is the DataFrame index and has no meaning here.
There are six different time series (a-f) for all different robots that are denoted by the ids column.

On the other hand, ``y`` contains the information which id belongs to a failure and which not:

+---+---+
| 1 | 0 |
+---+---+
| 2 | 0 |
+---+---+
| 3 | 0 |
+---+---+
| 4 | 0 |
+---+---+
| 5 | 0 |
+---+---+
|...|...|
+---+---+

Here, for the samples with ids 1 to 5 no failure was reported.

In the following we illustrate the time series of the sample id 3 reporting no failure:

.. image:: ../images/ts_example_robot_failures_nofail.png
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: the time series for id 3 (no failure)
   :align: center

And for id 20 reporting a failure:

.. image:: ../images/ts_example_robot_failures_fail.png
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: the time series for id 20 (failure)
   :align: center

Now tsfresh comes into place.
It allows us to automatically extract over 1200 features from those six different time series.

First we extract all features:

.. code:: python

    from tsfresh import extract_features
    extracted_features = extract_features(timeseries, column_id="id", column_sort="time")

You end up with all extracted features, which are more than 1200 different.
We will now remove all ``NaN`` values and select only the relevant features

.. code-block:: python

    from tsfresh import select_features
    from tsfresh.utilities.dataframe_functions import impute

    impute(extracted_features)
    features_filtered = select_features(extracted_features, y)


Only around 300 features were classified as relevant enough.

Further, you can even perform the extraction, imputing and filtering at the same time with the
:func:`tsfresh.convenience.extract_relevant_features` function:

.. code-block:: python

    from tsfresh import extract_relevant_features

    features_filtered_direct = extract_relevant_features(timeseries, y, column_id='id', column_sort='time')


You can now use the features contained in the Data Frame `features_filtered` (which is equal to
`features_filtered_direct`) in conjunction with `y` to train your model. Please see the `robot_failure_example.ipynb`
Jupyter Notebook in the folder named notebook. In this notebook a RandomForestClassifier is trained on the extracted
features.
