tsfresh uses `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`_

Unreleased
==========

- Breaking Change
    - Fix the sorting of the parameters in the feature names (#656)
      The feature names consist of a sorted list of all parameters now.
      That used to be true for all non-combiner features, and is now also true for combiner features.
      If you relied on the actual feature name, this is a breaking change.
    - Change the id after the rolling (#668)
      Now, the old id of your data is still kept. Additionally, we improved the way
      dataframes without a time column are rolled and how the new sub-time series
      are named.
      Also, the documentation was improved a lot.
