    Check the significance of all features (columns) of feature matrix X and return a possibly reduced feature matrix
    only containing relevant features.

    The feature matrix must be a pandas.DataFrame in the format:

        +-------+-----------+-----------+-----+-----------+
        | index | feature_1 | feature_2 | ... | feature_N |
        +=======+===========+===========+=====+===========+

    Each column will be handled as a feature and tested for its significance to the target.

    The target vector must be a pandas.Series or numpy.array in the form

        | index | target |
        +=======+========+
        | A     | ...    |

    that y has the same order and length than X and the rows correspond to each other.
