    Check the significance of all features (columns) of feature matrix X and return a possibly reduced feature matrix
    only containing relevant features.

    The feature matrix must be a pandas.DataFrame in the format:

        +-------+-----------+-----------+-----+-----------+
        | index | feature_1 | feature_2 | ... | feature_N |
        +=======+===========+===========+=====+===========+
        | A     | ...       | ...       | ... | ...       |
        +-------+-----------+-----------+-----+-----------+

        +-------+-----------+-----------+-----+-----------+
        | ...   | ...       | ...       | ... | ...       |

        | ...   | ...       | ...       | ... | ...       |
        +-------+-----------+-----------+-----+-----------+


    Each column will be handled as a feature and tested for its significance to the target.

    The target vector must be a pandas.Series or numpy.array in the form

        +-------+--------+
        | index | target |
        +=======+========+
        | A     | ...    |
        +-------+--------+
        | B     | ...    |
        +-------+--------+
        | .     | ...    |
        +-------+--------+
        | .     | ...    |
        +-------+--------+

    that y has the same order and length than X and the rows correspond to each other.

                      features among all created features.

                    Defaults to `'auto'`, meaning the intended task is inferred from `y`.
                    If `y` has a boolean, integer or object dtype, the task is assumend to be classification,
                    else regression.

    :return: The same DataFrame as X, but possibly with reduced number of columns ( = features).

    :raises: ``ValueError`` when the target vector does not fit to the feature matrix
