    """
    The settings object for controlling the feature significance tests.
    Normally, you do not have to handle these settings on your own, as the chosen defaults are quite sensible.

    This object is passed to most functions in the feature_selection submodules.

    If you want non-default settings, create a new settings object and pass it to the functions, for example if you
    want a less conservative selection of features you could increase the fdr level to 10%.

    >>> from tsfresh.feature_selection import FeatureSignificanceTestsSettings
    >>> settings = FeatureSignificanceTestsSettings()
    >>> settings.fdr_level = 0.1
    >>> from tsfresh.feature_selection import select_features
    >>> select_features(X, y, feature_selection_settings=settings)

    This selection process will return more features as the fdr level was raised.
