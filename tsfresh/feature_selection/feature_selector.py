Contains a feature selection method that evaluates the importance of the different extracted features. To do so,
for every feature the influence on the target is evaluated by an univariate tests and the p-Value is calculated.
The methods that calculate the p-values are called feature selectors.

Afterwards the Benjamini Hochberg procedure which is a multiple testing procedure decides which features to keep and
which to cut off (solely based on the p-values).
