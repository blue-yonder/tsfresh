class FeatureExtractionSettings(object):
    """
    This class defines the behaviour of feature extraction, in particular which feature and parameter combinations are calculated.
    If you do not specify any user settings, all features will be extracted with default arguments defined in this class.

    In general, we consider three types of time series features:

    1. aggregate features without parameter that emit exactly one feature per function calculator
    2. aggregate features with parameter that emit exactly one feature per function calculator
    3. apply features with parameters that emit several features per function calculator (usually one feature per parameter value)

    These three types are stored in different dictionaries. For the feature types with parameters there is also a
    dictionary containing the parameters.

    It is possible to obtain a `FeatureExtractionSettings` object from a feature matrix,
    see func:`~tsfresh.feature_extraction.settings.FeatureExtractionSettings.from_columns`. This is useful to reproduce
    the features of a train set for a test set.

    To set user defined settings, do something like

    >>> from tsfresh.feature_extraction import FeatureExtractionSettings
    >>> settings = FeatureExtractionSettings()
    >>> # Calculate all features except length
    >>> settings.do_not_calculate("length")
    >>> from tsfresh.feature_extraction import extract_features
    >>> extract_features(df, feature_extraction_settings=settings)

    Mostly, the settings in this class are for enabling/disabling the extraction of certain features, which can be
    important to save time during feature extraction. Additionally, some of the features have parameters which can be
    controlled here.

    If the calculation of a feature failed (for whatever reason), the results can be NaN. The IMPUTE flag defaults to
    `None` and can be set to one of the impute functions in :mod:`~tsfresh.utilities.dataframe_functions`.
