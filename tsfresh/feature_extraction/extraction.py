    Extract time series features for a given data frame based on the passed settings.

    This is an internal function, please use the extract_features function.

    The `dataframe` is expected to have at least two columns: column_id and column_value. The data is grouped together
    by their column_id value and the time series features are calculated independently for each of the groups.
    As a result, the function returns a :class:`pandas.DataFrame` with the ids as an index and as many columns as there
    were features calculated.

    To distinguish the features from others, all the calculated columns are given the prefix passed in by column_prefix.

    For example, if you pass in a `dataframe` of shape

        +====+=======+=====+
        | id | value | ... |
        +====+=======+=====+
