class FeatureSelector(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    """
    Sklearn-compatible estimator, for reducing the number of features in a dataset to only those,
    that are relevant and significant to a given target. It is basically a wrapper around
    :func:`~tsfresh.feature_selection.feature_selector.check_fs_sig_bh`.

    The check is done by testing the hypothesis

        :math:`H_0` = the Feature is not relevant and can not be added`

    against

        :math:`H_1` = the Feature is relevant and should be kept

    using several statistical tests (depending on whether the feature or/and the target is binary
    or not). Using the Benjamini Hochberg procedure, only features in :math:`H_0` are rejected.

    This estimator - as most of the sklearn estimators - works in a two step procedure. First, it is fitted
    on training data, where the target is known:

    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> X_train, y_train = pd.DataFrame(), pd.Series() # fill in with your features and target
    >>> from tsfresh.transformers import FeatureSelector
    >>> selector = FeatureSelector()
    >>> selector.fit(X_train, y_train)

    In this example the list of relevant features is empty:

    >>> selector.relevant_features
    >>> []

    The same holds for the feature importance:

    >>> selector.feature_importances_
    >>> array([], dtype=float64)

    The estimator keeps track on those features, that were relevant in the training step. If you
    apply the estimator after the training, it will delete all other features in the testing
    data sample:

    >>> X_test = pd.DataFrame()
    >>> X_selected = selector.transform(X_test)

    After that, X_selected will only contain the features that were relevant during the training.

    If you are interested in more information on the features, you can look into the member
    ``relevant_features`` after the fit.
